/**
 * An ontological element which models and categorises the various Attribute in the graph.
 * This ontological element behaves similarly to Type when defining how it relates to other
 * types. It has two additional functions to be aware of:
 * 1. It has a DataType constraining the data types of the values it's instances may take.
 * 2. Any of it's instances are unique to the type.
 * For example if you have an AttributeType modelling month throughout the year there can only be one January.
 *
 * @param <D> The data type of this resource type.
 *            Supported Types include: String, Long, Double, and Boolean
